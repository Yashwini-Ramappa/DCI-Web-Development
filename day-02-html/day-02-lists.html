        <p><b>Preparation:</b>
            South Indian Filter Coffee Recipe is a favourite Indian beverage that is served along with breakfast. South Indians love this coffee recipe during evenings and they pair it up with a variety of snacks or breads. In most South Indian homes, you can get the waft of freshly brewed coffee in the mornings.

            The taste of filter coffee depends on the coffee powder used. Some Filter Coffee powder has added chicory which changes the flavour of the extracted filter coffee. 
            
            The filter coffee is traditionally served in small steel tumbler and dabarah (container/cup) that is used to cool and mix the coffee. Pouring the coffee between the tumbler and the dabarah creates the classic frothy layer over the filter coffee. 
            
            Serve South Indian Filter Coffee Recipe along with Vegetable Rava Upma and South Indian Coconut Chutney for breakfast or with an evening snack such as Mullu Murukku.</p>
